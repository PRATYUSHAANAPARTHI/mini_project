        <p style="border-style:groove;border-color:blueviolet">ABOUT THE HISTORY OF MANALI</p>



            <p>The magnificent hill station of India, Manali retains a quiet interesting history. More than the history it would be called as a myth or a belief of the legends of this alluring beauty. As per the say of the legends and the natives, Manali has the home to the Lawgiver Many and while he was searching for his safe house, Manali provided him with the safe shelter and environment. As the days were going, once he found a ting fish in the bathing water and the fish asked him to look after her with devotion and in return, one day she would provide him with a great service. As per the say of the fish, Vaivasvatatava looked after the fish until the fish grew extremely huge and she was departed to the sea. Before the departure, she warned Manu about the deluge where the entire world will be submerged under the water and he would build a sea-worthy ark. As the world was submerged under the water because of the flood, the Seven Sages and the Vaivasvata were provided the safety by the Matsya, the fish who is considered to be the first avatar of Lord Vishnu.As the water level subsided the seventh Manuâ€™s ark came for the rest on hillside and then, this place got its name Manali after him. With the steady process of the drying of the water, the place here came out as a breath taking beauty and the life began again at Manali.The high mountains here were covered with white yet silent snow and the deep boulder strewn gorges, the forests started growing thick with woody trees and the weather with breezy winds with the songs of the birds made this place a legendary cradle for human life and now is the prominent tourist destination of India.
