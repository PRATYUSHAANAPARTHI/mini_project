        <p>In December 1911 King George V of Britain decreed that the capital of British India would be moved from Calcutta (now Kolkata) to Delhi. Construction began in 1912 at a site about 3 miles (5 km) south of the Delhi city centre, and the new capital was formally dedicated in 1931. The straight and diagonal pattern of the broad tree-lined avenues in New Delhi, with extensive green spaces and wide vistas, contrasts sharply with the crowded, narrow, and winding streets characteristic of Old Delhi. The main east-west axis of New Delhi is Central Vista Park, which is flanked by government buildings, museums, and research centres in a parklike setting. The city is governed by the appointed New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC). Area city, 16.5 square miles (42.7 square km). Pop (2001) 302,363.<br><br><br><br><br></p>
