        <p>Taj Mahal</p>
           <p> “The embodiment of all things pure”, said Rudyard Kipling on Taj Mahal’s beauty and that is no wordplay as the Taj is undoubtedly a pure epitome of beauty. It is an immortal poem in white marble and is the finest expression of love of an emperor for his queen. Located on a bank of River Yamuna, it was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife and Queen Mumtaz Mahal in 1631, who died giving birth to his child and whose last wish to her husband was “to build such a tomb in her memory which the world has never seen before.” It took over 17 years, 22000 workers and 1000 elephants to build the wonderful mausoleum.
            
            The Taj Mahal is one of the three World Heritage Sites in India. Set in a serene Mughal Garden the monument stands on a raised marble platform, with its back towards Yamuna River. The four sides of the Taj Mahal show a perfect symmetry and feature impressive vaulted arches embellished with Pietra Dura scrollwork, and verses from the Quran in calligraphy using inlaid jasper. This architectural masterpiece is one of the most frequented places in India by photographers and foreign tourists. The Taj Mahal looks as immaculate today as when it was first built, leaving the onlookers mesmerized.
            
            </p><br><br><p>Agra Fort</p>
            <p>A massive red-sandstone fort located on the banks of River Yamuna was built under the commission of Emperor Akbar in 1565 and was further built by his grandson Shah Jahan. The fort, semi-circular on plan, is surrounded by a 21.4 m high fortification wall. The fort was built primarily as a military structure; parts of it are still reserved under Indian Army. Shah Jahan transformed it into a palace, later it became his gilded prison for eight years after his son Aurangzeb seized power in 1658. The fort houses a maze of buildings, including vast underground sections. The Amar Singh Gate to the south is the sole entry point. A path leads straight from here up to the large Moti Masjid. Just before this is the open Diwan-e-Aam, where Shah Jahan listened to people’s petitions or issues. A small staircase just to the left of Diwan-e-Aam throne leads up to a large courtyard. To the left is a beautiful white marble Nagina Masjid. Other places to see within the Fort are: Diwan-e-Khas - which once housed Shah Jahan’s legendary Peacock throne and the diamond Koh-I-Noor, Shish Mahal- a palace with walls inlaid with tiny mirrors, and Khas Mahal - the white octagonal tower and palace. In the South of the fort, there is a huge red-sandstone Jahangir’s Palace, built by Akbar probably for his son Jahangir.
