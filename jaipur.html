       1. The whole Jaipur city was surrounded by a 6 & 3 meter (height & width) wall with eight gates in all four directions. Now, this is the Pink City area of Jaipur (Old Jaipur) I am talking about. So anyone who wants to enter or exit from Jaipur city has to pass through these gates.
        
        And inside the city, the construction was planned in a unique way of a 3×3 grid system which made it very easy for locals to travel across Jaipur, as all the small lanes of Jaipur would end up on the main road. Making is almost impossible to get lost in Jaipur.
        <br><br>
        2. As I mentioned above, that Jaipur city has a total of 8 gates, which are 1. Jorawar Singh Gate, 2. Surajpole Gate, 3. Sanganeri Gate, 4. New Gate, 5. Ajmeri Gate, 6. Chandpole Gate, 7. Ghat Gate and 8. Samrat Gate. And it is believed that these gates protect Jaipur from invaders and even natural calamities. There is a saying in Jaipur, which is:

        “Amer ki Sheela Devi, Chandpol Ka Hanuman. Sanganer ka Sanga Baba, Jeet Laya Raja Maan.”
        
        What this line means, I will tell that a bit below, but before that, you should know that one of Maharaja of Jaipur, Raja Maan Singh, who was also a famous Polo player, had set up temples of Sheela Devi, Hanuman & Sanga Baba (a saint) in three corners of Jaipur (west, south, and north). Since then, many incidents have happened, which made the local belief stronger that Jaipur is blessed against natural & un-natural calamity.
        
        Whether it was the flood of 1981 or the terror attack of 2008, nothing happened in Jaipur. A total of 26 bombs got recovered near Chandpol Gate and nine more near Sanganeri Gate. A total of 35 bombs planted by terror groups didn’t go off, saving the lives of 100s of innocent people.
        
        So the saying above means that “Goddess Sheela of Amer, Lord Hanuman at Chandpol, the Sanga Saint at Sanganer, have blessed Maharaja Maan Singh”
        <br><br>
        3. Did you know Jaipur still has a Maharaja? His name is Padmanabh Singh, and he was crowned Maharaja of Jaipur at a tender young age of 13. You will not find him win battles anymore, but instead, you will find him grace the cover of a fashion magazine, or on Instagram, striking an elegant pose in the royal interiors of Jaipur City Palace.

        He plays Polo, and it is not surprising that he excels in it, because it runs in his blood!!! Polo was a sport that almost all Maharajas of Jaipur played, and it’s therefore not surprising that young Padmanabh Singh picked up this sport from a young age. He has even represented India in international Polo championships, and is a member of the Guards Polo Club in England.
        
        Padmanabh Singh is the eldest son of Diya Kumari, the daughter of Jaipur’s last ruling Maharaja, Sawai Bhawani Singh. He lives with the royal family in Jaipur City Palace, and recently he placed a luxurious suite on AirBnB. He studies Liberal Arts in New York University, and he frequently visits Jaipur where he now stays in Suján Rajmahal Palace.

        4. If you are searching for the most expensive hotel stay in the world, than it’s in Jaipur. The Raj Mahal Palace hotel in Amer Jaipur has a Suite room (presidential suite) with a room tariff of $50,000 per night.
